<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is mainly made for a Discord Bot that is written in C#. I am not perfect at it and also will try to add as many things as possible. Feel free to contribute!

Here's why I came up with the idea:
* I want to create an unique bot
* The bot should be written from the start without copying others in the slightest way - it obviously will happen, that you can find features that are similar to other bots, but they are writte by me.
* It should be usable for YOU to learn about C# and Discord itself :smile:
+ It should take away some work from your moderators, dependant on what features I am gonna add to it. 


### Built With

* [![Cs][C#.cs]][CSharp-url]
* [![DiscordSharp][DiscordSharp]][DiscordSharp-url]
